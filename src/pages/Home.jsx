      <TextBlock 
        title="What is Superfloat?" 
        content="Superfloat is a custom quantization algorithm that operates with a scalable precision format.
         Unlike IEEE-754 floating-point, it eliminates the mantissa and focuses entirely on the exponent for efficient AI edge computation.
         Traditional floating-point formats waste memory and compute cycles handling mantissas that are rarely critical in edge scenarios. 
         Superfloat streamlines the process by keeping only what matters — the exponent — making AI inference faster, lighter, and more power-efficient.
         Superfloat is designed for AI at the edge — from IoT devices and autonomous drones to wearable tech and robotics. Wherever power efficiency and fast inference matter, 
         Superfloat offers a scalable alternative to traditional floating-point arithmetic."
